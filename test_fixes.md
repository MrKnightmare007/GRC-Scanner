# Testing the GRC Scanner Fixes

## What was fixed:

1. **Progress Tracking**: Added real-time progress updates during scanning
   - Shows "Checking Headers", "Scanning open ports - 1/447", etc.
   - Progress is stored in database and displayed in frontend

2. **Download Issue**: Fixed the PDF download functionality
   - Changed from relative URLs to proper API calls with blob handling
   - Added proper error handling for download failures

3. **Status Display**: Enhanced scan results display
   - Shows detailed scan results instead of just "completed"
   - Displays security headers, OWASP analysis, and port scan results
   - Better UI with Bootstrap styling

## To test:

1. **Start the backend**:
   ```bash
   cd GrcScanner/backend
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Start the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd GrcScanner/frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Test the scanning process**:
   - Login/Register a user
   - Enter a URL to scan (e.g., https://example.com)
   - Watch the progress updates: "Checking Headers", "Scanning open ports - 1/447", etc.
   - When complete, see detailed results instead of just "completed"
   - Click "Download PDF Report" to test the download functionality

## Expected behavior:

- **During scan**: Progress updates like "Checking Headers", "Analyzing OWASP vulnerabilities", "Scanning open ports - 1/447"
- **After completion**: Status shows "Completed" with detailed scan results displayed
- **Download**: PDF downloads properly without routing errors
- **History**: Shows all scans with proper status and download buttons

## Database changes:

- Added `progress` column to track scan progress
- Added `scan_results` column to store detailed JSON results
- Migration script automatically updates existing databases
